## Getting Started
The following UI design was created through different components that include jQuery, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and CSS3. The different pages include the log-in page that goes towards the dashboard page. The dashboard page includes different "buttons", that have different timers for each action. There is also a left side-nav bar that can navigate towards the home, settings, and stats button.

The settings page can customize which events show up on the dashboard.

The statistics page show different graphs for different data that you would like to see. There is also an overview that is shown.


## Bugs and Issues

Current issues: Re-sizing format issues for different tablet sizes/screens.
